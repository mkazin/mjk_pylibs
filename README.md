 _mjk-pylibs_
=============

My personal collection of Python Libraries.

_fileparser_ is a quick and dirty library I built to extract information
from structured files.  It's not pretty or efficient and should only be
used in appropriate applications.  I'm very open to getting advice about
optimizing it, and improving my (very basic) Python skills.


Licensing is still under consideration, but will definitely fall in line with 
a non-restrictive, open source license, probably something like MIT, which
will allow incorporation in commercial projects, and may not even require
attribution.  Feel free to use it and contact me if concerned (or have 
suggestions) about the eventual license.
